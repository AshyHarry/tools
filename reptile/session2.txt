1
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,590
This is CS50, Friday of Week 0.

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,280
Welcome back for those returning,

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,020
welcome to CS50 for those joining us for the first time.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,780
Typically, we will not in fact have classes on Fridays,

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,110
just this week and next for

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,300
shopping week and Labor Day.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,760
But thereafter we will indeed be Monday, Wednesday.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,090
So, one of the side effects perhaps of a course like this

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,460
is that it begins to open your eyes to all sorts of

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,820
technical curiosities in society and technical

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,420
inaccuracies in society. And so what I did this morning,

12
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,890
this is literally how I spent my morning, well, it was

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,510
troll around YouTube looking for nice incarnations of

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,200
things that perhaps yesterday you might not have blinked at

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,700
that but 10 weeks from now you should absolutely poke fun

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,840
at these people. So with that said,

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,340
I give you a little something from YouTube.

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,720
For weeks I've been investigating the murders

19
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,240
with a certain morbid fascination.

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,880
This isn't real-time.

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,170
I'll create a GUI interface using Visual Basic,

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,130
see if I can track an IP address.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,040
So there we have, I'll create a GUI

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,630
interface using Visual Basic,

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,140
see if I can track an IP address.

26
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,200
So, a lot of technical words independently that are very

27
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,850
much accurate and used in technical context.

28
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,030
But GUI, graphical user interface, kind of said,

29
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,280
a graphical user interface, two using Visual Basic.

30
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,860
So this is kind of a modern show

31
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,770
and that is kind of a retro language

32
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,750
and it's also as will be one of the takeaways of this

33
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,700
course completely irrelevant to

34
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,120
what problem you are solving,

35
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,940
the fact that this engineer is using--proclaiming to use

36
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,960
Visual Basic really is not a compelling part of the story.

37
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,340
And finally, see if I can track an IP address.

38
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,530
Well, all of that might in fact be the goal

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,170
but it's when you start hearing things like this hopefully

40
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,370
that you at least start to grimace a little bit.

41
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,720
And let me pull up a second one,

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,650
it turns out it's also from CSI.

43
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,930
Let me make sure that the user annotations are disabled

44
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,790
this time and let's take a little look at this one here.

45
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,480
This is the vacation shot,

46
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,250
it gives us something to work with.

47
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,390
The tourist was taking a picture of this girl.

48
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,570
So, margin the reflection in her eye.

49
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,300
Just slide the image over.

50
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,800
And there is our victim, our program.

51
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,200
Okay, so when you are working with

52
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,100
source material that looks like this,

53
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,670
there is in fact no such thing as

54
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,300
infinite zoom in computer science.

55
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,610
You cannot just tell the computer to enhance

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,330
that or can you clean that up and then magically

57
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,510
use zoom in not only on the image but also on the

58
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,720
reflection of the victim in someone's eyeball.

59
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,900
So here too are they taking some liberties.

60
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,160
But thankfully I also found in my trolling around

61
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,270
this morning,something that is perhaps technically

62
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,480
motivating and at least remains for those of you

63
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,380
which is many of you who actually use Gmail,

64
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,430
you might have seen a little advert in the top right

65
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,160
hand corner recently saying new beta version of a

66
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,490
little something called Gmail Priority Inbox.

67
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
So this one is not a spoof,

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,100
it's actually a pretty cute video

69
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,270
and it offers us the opportunity to just take a look at some

70
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,510
of the kinds of ideas we'll be looking at in this course.

71
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,960
So I give you your Gmail Priority Inbox.

72
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,890
If you haven't turned it on

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,460
or don't know what that thing is

74
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,220
here we go.

75
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,880
So, if you've ever wondered,

76
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,320
that is in fact how Gmail works underneath the hood?

77
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,910
So, what are the takeaways though for us?

78
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,590
So there're actually some really interesting

79
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,680
computer science ideas underlying

80
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,250
that we promised on Wednesday that computer science.

81
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,560
And this course in particular

82
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,940
isn't at the end of the day about programming even though

83
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,360
that is in fact how you will spend a good amount of your

84
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,490
time and the skill that you will in fact walk away with.

85
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,890
But it's about approaching something

86
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,760
that you actually care about,

87
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,970
for instance, just--it's even something work a day like

88
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,380
managing your email and getting through the day more

89
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,120
efficiently and trying to answer a lot more cleverly, a lot

90
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,950
more effectively questions like which things do I care

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,920
I mean these are the kinds of things the computers

92
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,490
can in fact if programmed effectively help us with.

93
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,960
So this little video suggested

94
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,450
there're a couple of heuristics that a computer or

95
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,940
that a programmer could use to figure out what emails

96
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,040
are important to someone like me.

97
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,140
We look at what emails you reply to

98
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,170
if you reply in theory that suggests

99
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,890
this user must care about whoever sent this email

100
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,240
or the topic they are in.

101
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,450
If you actually read it,

102
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,890
that's a useful indicator.

103
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,870
Are there other indicators or tricks or rules of thumb

104
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,880
that just off the top of your head come to you

105
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,730
as useful mechanisms for doings this as well?

106
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,940
Yeah.

107
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,630
So that's a good one.

108
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,840
So, whether or not the email

109
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,280
is addressed specifically to you in like the two field

110
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,660
or if maybe you were BCC'd or it's a big email list of which

111
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,320
you're just part, that could signify

112
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,130
that this is in fact useful for you.

113
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,560
Yeah,in the back.

114
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,200
So what the subject is, okay,

115
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,920
so if it's something like, you know,

116
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,060
buy such and such, a whole bunch of spam.

117
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,370
I mean buy could actually be a negative indicator

118
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,500
that this is probably not of interest to the user.

119
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,890
Whereas please help or dinner or something like that

120
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,160
might actually be more compelling to a human.

121
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,640
Other thoughts that come to mind.

122
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,610
Yeah,in the middle.

123
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,090
Okay, good. So in Gmail context most of you know,

124
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,650
you cannot--you can delete things

125
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,720
but most people just save or archive emails.

126
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,780
So if you archive it,

127
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,540
that's maybe a little hint that either this is

128
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,260
just your habit or perhaps that you might

129
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,390
actually care about this later in the future,

130
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,740
whereas if you delete it, no,

131
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,450
you really don't care. Yeah.

132
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,550
So who the sender is,

133
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,680
so maybe you could keep track of just who your most frequent

134
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,640
correspondents are and if you keep

135
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,130
seeing the same personfrom person X or person Y coming

136
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,980
into your inbox and clearlyI like having a dialog

137
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,000
with these people or have to for work,

138
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,960
that might in fact bubble up in your inbox.

139
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,660
Other thoughts?

140
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,050
Speed of response, right,

141
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,120
so I actually do tend to respond to

142
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,840
some people's emails more quickly than others

143
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,040
and that in fact might be a useful indicator.

144
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,450
And if I'm already in this habit, let my software,

145
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,360
let my computer do that thinking for me and bubble up to

146
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,250
the top of my attention what I should address first.

147
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,340
And another idea？

148
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,400
So how long you leave the window open.

149
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,990
So this one too is an interesting heuristic

150
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,400
and these kinds of ideas are actually really

151
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,490
prevalent in like the advertising world,

152
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,350
and I'm sure of sites like Facebook

153
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,760
and the like actually do keep track of how much time

154
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,510
you spend using this application or

155
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,550
how much time you spend on this particular page

156
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,500
so that they can infer from that behavior

157
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,800
what you actually care about and what you might

158
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,320
actually look at more intensely.

159
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,500
So feel free to play with this if you like.

160
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,450
I just turned it on literally this morning to start playing

161
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,520
and I'm on myself a couple of email lists,

162
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,850
one of which had an email this morning saying,

163
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,630
"Hey, has anyone tried this,

164
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,170
it really kind of sucks."

165
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,400
Whereas the other email list said completely the opposite.

166
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,060
So it's this interesting scenario

167
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,530
where it's probably hit or miss,

168
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,230
certainly early on and as one

169
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,490
of the clips they are indicated,

170
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,690
these are the kinds of things where

171
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,510
computers ideally have to learn overtime.

172
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,820
A priori, Google has probably not going to know

173
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,880
what you care about.

174
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,860
But if it watches you over some amount of time

175
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,810
just like it's been for years with advertisements,

176
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,280
can this kind of algorithm,

177
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,460
this kind of process presumably improve?

178
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,850
So that's perhaps a hint of

179
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,520
where we're going in the future.

180
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,310
So for those of you joining us for the last time,

181
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,950
know that the video of Wednesday

182
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,200
as will generally be the case is already online.

183
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,220
You can go to cs50.net/lectures

184
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,090
and that will lead you to a link

185
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,230
where the video is nicely embedded in HDV. Thanks to our

186
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,940
video grapplers this year. What you'll see here is a little

187
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,760
clip of what I showed on Wednesday whereby this semester

188
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,730
for the first time we'll be including after a few days,

189
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,540
it takes a few days of human labor to—

190
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,030
we will be transcribing the lectures

191
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,270
in their entirety word for word,

192
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,620
awkward as this is for me to actually see the words

193
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,640
I'm saying in retrospect. But you will then be able to read

194
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,610
what's there. Do keyword search based on anything that I

195
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,380
happen to say, if you search for this in a few days' time.

196
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,460
And similarly can you click on any sentence in the

197
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,740
transcript, jump right to that point in the video.

198
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,620
So thisis very much online education CS50 style.

199
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,480
And if you speak other languages that I don't,

200
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,070
you can nonetheless compel me

201
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,530
to speak them at least in subtitle form.

202
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,330
So I wanted to take a few excerpts

203
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,610
from the course's syllabus

204
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,190
since it's not an interesting document to walk through line

205
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,490
by line, but something you should read at some point very

206
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,200
soon. What ultimately matters in this course is not—

207
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,250
is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates

208
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,340
but where you end up in week 12

209
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,000
relative to yourself in week 0.

210
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,040
And so this really is the mantra of the course.

211
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,410
One of the concerns out of the

212
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,850
gate for students in this course,

213
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,780
particularly those we dub less comfortable

214
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,010
is that you're already starting off at a disadvantage.

215
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,970
My god, this student sitting next to me

216
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,030
was programming since he or she was 6.

217
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,920
This person next to me took AP computer science,

218
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,750
and that may actually be the case.

219
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,580
And statistically it probably is the case to some extents

220
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,990
but it really doesn't matter.

221
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,220
I mean unlike a lot of the courses here and at universities,

222
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,460
we really do take a much more individualistic approach

223
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,640
and that is to say at the end of the day

224
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,320
do we consider both upward trending,

225
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,600
both your initial experience

226
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,470
and also how you approach the

227
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,190
course's projects throughout

228
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,350
the course of the semester.

229
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,250
You can nonetheless take the course Pass/Fail.

230
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,500
I mentioned this on Wednesday.

231
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,500
This is actually something very near and dear to my heart

232
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,940
because I literally would not be doing what I do in life today

233
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,440
had I not taken a couple of courses here,

234
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,190
this one in particular, pass fail.

235
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,200
It helped me in my mind sort of take that step

236
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,430
that I was otherwise just a little too hesitant

237
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,660
to take in my freshman year.

238
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,050
And then for a lot of students too,

239
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,360
what this mechanism does is it just takes the edge off

240
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,390
a course like this.

241
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,690
Odds are if you're an upperclassman,

242
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,790
you've had that experience where it's 12 AM, 1 AM, 2 AM,

243
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,040
and you're really starting to stress over

244
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,430
the incompletion of some problems that for some course,

245
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,320
well frankly what this mechanism allows you to do

246
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,570
if you're already 90 percent of the way there,

247
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,200
you can call it a night and you can put it down

248
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,380
and you could feel good nonetheless about where you got to.

249
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,340
And that in my mind

250
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,690
is one of the upsides of taking a course like this,

251
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,850
pass fail, in order to take the edge off.

252
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,200
The course is not FYI graded on the curve.

253
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,600
There is no pre-determined cutoffs

254
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,840
between letter grades for those

255
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,830
who do take letter grades,

256
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,540
and those less comfortable and somewhere

257
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,690
in between are not at a disadvantage

258
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,750
as the syllabus promises vis-a-vis those more comfortable.

259
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,410
We do in fact--I do have conversations with all

260
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,230
30 plus of the teaching fellows about all

261
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,580
300 plus of the students at the end of the semester,

262
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,850
and that is in the end what determines the outcome.

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,330
So some of the mechanisms that are in place now to make the

264
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,540
next several weeks among the most memorable of experiences.

265
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,470
So with the problems,

266
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,530
that is where you really will get your hands dirty

267
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,750
and truly immerse yourself in this world

268
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,370
of computer science and programming.

269
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,080
But life happens, stuff comes up with sports,

270
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,860
with student groups, with elements and the like.

271
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,110
So the course very generously offers 9 late days that you can

272
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,080
spend accurate discretion throughout the semester.

273
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,210
You can take one late day on one piece set,

274
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,890
9 late days on one piece set.

275
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,530
It really is up to you to manage throughout the term.

276
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,320
We also drop the lowest score on a problem set and also lest

277
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,340
in my appeal in the last lecture in this sounds a little

278
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,950
too tailored to only those less comfortable realize too

279
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,060
those more comfortable as we'll see today.

280
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,350
For those do we offer what we call

281
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,440
hacker editions of each of the problem sets.

282
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,530
We do expect the majority of the students to tackle,

283
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,880
as you'll see tonight when the

284
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,450
PDFs go online at 7 PM,

285
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,970
the so called standard edition of each problem set.

286
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,120
But if you are so inclined whether for this problem set or any

287
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,690
other throughout the term, you can change your mind week to week.

288
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,580
Do you have available to you what we call the hacker

289
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,310
editions in more details on those in the courses syllabus?

290
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,580
And besides that, lest that not be enough to make sure

291
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,790
everyone can succeed in a course like this,

292
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,920
we have a very diligent teaching fellow

293
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,250
who not only likes to scribe the courses lectures.

294
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,890
It's not much fun to read 20 pages

295
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,670
of my verbal text written.

296
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,740
But having a few pages of authoritative note do exist.

297
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,230
The teaching fellow for each lecture takes what we call scribe

298
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,330
notes. These are posted within a few days online.

299
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,250
He likes to include some snarky comments

300
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,420
on the footnotes generally about me at my expense.

301
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,690
So keep an eye up for those.

302
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,890
And the point of this is so that you don't come to

303
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,120
class heads down the whole time thinking everything

304
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,680
I say is absolutely worthy of being written down.

305
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,360
Ideally like we started today,

306
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,100
it will be a bit more like a conversation to the extent

307
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,090
that's possible in a theater like this.

308
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,350
One hundred fifty plus office hours is the current tally

309
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,470
that you'll see starting to appear on the course's website,

310
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,060
thanks to our 60 plus person staff and you'll also see

311
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,350
online soon once you have your accounts as per problem set 0 spec.

312
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,780
For the course's website,

313
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,560
there'll be support forms and an email address, help@cs50.net,

314
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,770
that you can turn to and frankly this is more

315
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,270
a commentary on our lack of social lives during the term.

316
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,620
But we pride ourselves generally on 5 or so minute response

317
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,190
times at most hours during the day.

318
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,520
So, it's a sick obsession with some of us,

319
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,490
myself included. So with that said, what can you do?

320
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,870
So this is such a silly thing, but 15 years ago,

321
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,380
I took this course followed by a course called CS51

322
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,530
and then sat down one night

323
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,040
and then I'm spending the next week on this project

324
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,350
even though I lived in Mather House,

325
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,950
never really was the shuttling type on a lot of Quad friends

326
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,950
who did, and this was kind of interesting to me.

327
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,950
There was this big printout of the shuttle schedule

328
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,260
and this was not a very navigable document.

329
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,380
Certainly this is like mid 1990s,

330
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,880
we did have the web and the internet

331
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,150
but things were slow

332
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,340
and it just wasn't really conducive to actually finding things

333
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,820
quickly unless you really gave some thought to the problem.

334
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,720
So I sat down over the course of a week

335
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,870
and implement what I probably shouldn't have called

336
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,220
Shuttleboy at the time '

337
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,380
cause this jargon has lived on.

338
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,330
And this is now a program that's web based,

339
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,770
it's SMS based, it's voice based

340
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,550
and it used to be Linux based

341
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,130
as you'll see in a couple of weeks and it's just a program

342
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,410
thatlet's you click where you are, click where you wanna go

343
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,460
and voila, here are the next several

344
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,350
shuttles that you can take.

345
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,730
I thought I'd give you a little glimpse at

346
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,260
what you can do for your final project toward terms end.

347
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,620
We own our own phone number,

348
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,350
that allows you to input key strokes like you would

349
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:07,800
any system and this is an example of what we call CS50 Voice.

350
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,020
And that's an example of someone else's phone.

351
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,960
This is CS50. For Shuttleboy, press 1.

352
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:20,900
To start over, Press 0. What is your origin?

353
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,730
For Quad, press 1; Mather, press 2;

354
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,550
Boylston, press 3; Lamont, press 4;

355
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,320
Mem Hall, press 5; to start over, press 0.

356
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,160
So press 1 for Quad.

357
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,540
The next shuttle leaves in 2 minutes at 1:30 PM

358
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:47,800
and then at 1:40 PM, 1:50 PM and 2 PM. This is CS50.

359
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:56,240
That is only option 1. We have like 9 more slots to fill.

360
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,060
So that's 9 potential final projects that

361
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,540
can live on in telephone form toward semester's end.

362
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,990
And we will show you exactly how you can write programs

363
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,330
that actually interact with the user in that way.

364
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,050
And just as a fun aside, we also realized as computer

365
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,980
scientists that sometimes

366
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,830
technology is not the answer.

367
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,110
This is an unfortunate thing you see throughout education

368
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,300
frankly, certainly at the secondary and primary school level

369
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,850
where you just insert technology into the classroom

370
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,740
and expect to solve problems, that is not in life always the case.

371
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,740
Sometimes the simplest solutions are in fact the best

372
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,600
and thus consistent with this constant reminder to

373
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,820
ourselves was born last year what we dubbed Shuttleboy Cards.

374
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,280
Now granted we're now starting to take

375
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,200
this all shuttle theme to an extreme perhaps,

376
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,010
but we realized you know what, it's actually not that

377
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,100
efficient sometimes to call a phone number,

378
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,140
it's not that efficient to pull up the mobile web.

379
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,400
Sometimes it's a lot easier

380
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,620
to reach into your wallet,

381
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,330
pull out a piece of plastic and voila,

382
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,900
there are the next several shuttle times.

383
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,310
We mention this only because we're just going to

384
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,130
press with the latest incarnation of this this year.

385
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,900
So if you go back to shuttleboy.cs50.net,

386
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,840
you can pre-order for free your own CS50 Shuttle Cards,

387
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,920
particularly those of you in the Quad, Mather and the like.

388
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:10,120
So, what does that mean as you exit a course like this?

389
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,700
Well really, the things we've looked at

390
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,740
thus far can you do after just a semester of this kind of

391
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,440
material and exposure to this particular world.

392
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,650
I just wanted to draw your attention to some of the handouts

393
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,590
we had Wednesday which are still available today

394
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,860
if you didn't yet get them.

395
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,370
This is targeted for the most part at students

396
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,750
who might want a major or minor in computer science,

397
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,630
but there's also some interesting detail

398
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,070
toward the end of this document,

399
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,130
if and when you get a chance to peruse, including this chart

400
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,110
that shows you the pathways that you can take

401
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,950
throughout computer science here,

402
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,580
sort of recommend it or popular courses that students

403
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,960
tend to take even if they are in the humanities or life sciences

404
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,450
or social sciences but want to round out their education here

405
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,430
with something in the computing sciences do we have quads of

406
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,880
courses recommended in the back that you can take after 50 in

407
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,650
order to get a minor in this stuff. And frankly this kind of

408
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,800
stuff, this visualization of data, this is one of the themes

409
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,300
of a course here called CS171, visualizations, which we'll

410
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,080
actually learn--hear a bit about

411
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,620
toward the end of the semester

412
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,790
and it's all about taking data that might very well

413
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,970
have come out of a computer and trying to decide

414
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,900
what is in fact the best way to present this data.

415
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,620
To be honest, especially those of you less comfortable here,

416
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,550
if you've ever struggled with some program or struggled with some

417
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,450
piece of software, oh it's alright, it's not your fault.

418
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,620
It just really wasn't designed very well.

419
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,840
So actually thinking about how humans interact with machines and

420
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,200
how you can optimize your so called user interface or GUI

421
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,440
interface is also one of the themes in this particular field.

422
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,800
So, we ended Wednesday with some quotes,

423
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,310
particularly from isawyouharvard.com,

424
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,810
we thought it would be fun to just give you a couple

425
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,400
of teasers from another favorite website of ours,

426
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,290
a little something called Harvard FML,

427
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,000
search for CS50 and you see some choice quotes like this.

428
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,300
I talk about CS50 so much that my teammates

429
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,400
implemented a CS50 talk tax.

430
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,440
I get charged one dollar for each mention of the class.

431
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,700
I already owed 20 dollars and haven't been able to talk for more

432
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,550
than five minutes without getting called out on it FML.

433
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,000
This is what happens over time as does--whoops!

434
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,800
Did I miss one there? This is what may, in fact,

435
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,220
happen to you over time.

436
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,590
We are a recurring theme it seems

437
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
on that particular website.

438
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,150
So now, let's make things a little more technical for a moment.

439
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,650
Those of you more comfortable,

440
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,260
rest assured we'll start filling in some gaps

441
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,040
before long if you're already familiar with this.

442
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,410
But all of you in this room probably remember

443
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,080
what we technically call the base 10 system

444
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,920
or decimal system because back in grade school or the like, you

445
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,250
learned to count and add and subtract numbers by way of columns.

446
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,600
The so called ones column on the right, the tens column next to

447
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,870
it, the hundreds column, the thousands column, and so forth.

448
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,270
So if you had some number back in grade school like 123,

449
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,970
well, why do we express this as 123?

450
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,640
When really I just see on the board 1, 2, 3？

451
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,030
Well, we have what?

452
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,010
One in the so called hundreds columns,

453
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,360
a two in the so called tens column

454
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,470
so that's 10 times 1 plus 10 times 2 is 120,

455
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,020
plus 3 times 1, 123 alright,

456
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,350
so completely  uninteresting,

457
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,950
if this is something long familiar to you,

458
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,560
but it turns out computers work in exactly the same way.

459
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,360
The so called binary system,

460
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,130
these zeros and ones that you'd probably have some

461
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,020
vague sense underlie all computers today actually

462
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,490
reduced to the exact same grade school kind of math

463
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,510
and system except with computers,

464
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,120
because it's a lot easier to use just two digits, zero and one.

465
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,900
Do they use only columns like with the ones column,

466
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,710
the twos columns, the fours column, and the eights column?

467
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,420
And if you noticed earlier that these are

468
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,090
what we'd call powers of ten, these are just powers of two.

469
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,300
So if you need more--bigger numbers,

470
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,660
you just have a 16's column and a 32's column, and so forth.

471
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,230
So what's the takeaway here?

472
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,830
Well, if we actually want to represent

473
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,140
something like the number 7, well in binary,

474
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,970
not actually in decimal like this.

475
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,440
Well, what do we do?

476
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,080
If we need a 7, this is the ones column, the twos, fours, eights,

477
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,570
so here are our columns and this was

478
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,240
our decimal system a moment ago,

479
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,360
and I wanna express the number 7 and the only digits

480
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,270
I now have access to are zero and one,

481
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,340
whereas, in decimal, dec meaning 10.

482
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,850
I had zero to 9, which was 10, zero and 1,

483
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,870
bi meaning two, high binary numbers.

484
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,870
I can only put a zero or 1 in each of these slides.

485
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,640
But after that, the math is the same,

486
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,320
eight times whatever, four times whatever,

487
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,840
two times whatever, and so forth. So what's 7?

488
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,050
Right, one, one, one and then a zero.

489
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,680
And just like in the decimal system,

490
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,170
you can put as many leading zeros, any—

491
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,810
as many zeros on the left that you want.

492
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,300
They're completely inconsequential

493
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,750
and so we now have the number 7.

494
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,330
Meanwhile, the number zero is. Alright, it's all zeros

495
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,000
so I'll--just for consistency, use four of them here,

496
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,690
but that's just an aesthetic.

497
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,210
And I mentioned on Wednesday that computer scientists do

498
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,610
in fact start counting from zero not one.

499
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,980
Well, this is pretty much why.

500
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,340
Because if you ever hold—

501
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:09,390
the numbering system reduces to this basic idea of zeros and ones,

502
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,420
each of which is in a certain column,

503
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,860
each of which has some weights associated with it,

504
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,900
it's just natural. It's obvious to start counting at zero.

505
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,110
Otherwise, you're wasting a bit, so to speak, unnecessarily.

506
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,340
And a bit, B-I-T, just a shorthand for binary digit,

507
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,960
so a digit of zero over a  one, bi means two,

508
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,290
you only have two digits.

509
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,410
Hence, the word bit was born.

510
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,810
So just as a little sanity check, number 15 in binary would be?

511
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:41,510
Just four ones, and how about the number 65,535?

512
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,610
Anyone?

513
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,280
You know you're a nerd if--so 16 of those ones

514
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,630
will give you that particular number.

515
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,330
And I can't, myself, go higher than that

516
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,280
but you could certainly do it mathematically.

517
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,750
Now this is not the kind of stuff that

518
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,380
computer scientists spend all their time doing,

519
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,900
but it will germane.

520
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,160
In fact, midway through the semester,

521
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,440
when we look at the notion of digital forensics

522
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,510
and recovering things like JPEGS and representing files

523
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,810
like JPEGS and JIPS and the like on disk

524
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,710
we're actually gonna have to revisit this  idea

525
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,550
of actually storing information in zero or one form

526
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,050
and so it's going to become relevant as to

527
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,820
how you represent these numbers on disk,

528
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,520
how you manipulate these numbers on  disk,

529
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,550
but this really only gives us

530
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,730
the ability to express numbers at this point in time.

531
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,500
We ultimately wanna be able to express letters

532
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,780
so we can implement

533
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,140
things like Gmail

534
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,890
and actually implement text on the screen.

535
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,750
So how do we do that?

536
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,250
Well first, a cartoon that you might now

537
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,640
actually get those otherwise unfamiliar.

538
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,470
See this happens every semester that the chuckles, the grimaces,

539
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,620
kind of roll through the crowd as people catch on,

540
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,890
but there you go.

541
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,440
Now, you get geek humor.

542
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,260
And for better or for worse we've done

543
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,970
a lot of damage over the past few years for this stuff.

544
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,460
When you get more and more acquainted with geek humor

545
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,680
from the likes of this is Foxtrot XKCD is popular,

546
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,050
Ph.D. comics, there's a whole bunch of geekery

547
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,000
out there that will perhaps turn to—

548
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,560
so that you do exit this course as a complete side effect

549
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,710
with an understanding as to why it was funny

550
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,550
or at least awkward that we did, in fact on Wednesday,

551
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,050
have a CAT pictured in a ceiling.

552
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,220
So, how do you go from just numbers, zeros

553
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,330
and ones to actually useful information?

554
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,290
Well it turns out a bunch of years ago

555
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,640
people just decided that if we have the ability

556
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,850
to express numbers and we actually

557
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,090
care about expressing letters of  the alphabet,

558
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,130
well we just need some kind of mapping between one and the other,

559
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,190
and so thus was born what's generally called the ASCII.

560
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,120
This is just an acronym that you still see and use today,

561
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,900
though there were newer systems that are more

562
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,140
expressive for other languages, non-romance languages.

563
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,050
But ASCII is just a code.

564
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,600
This might look a little cryptic at first,

565
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,500
but it turns there is some very obvious patterns here,

566
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,250
for instance. According to this chart,

567
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,470
if you want to represent the letter A

568
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,180
in the so called ASCII system,

569
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,930
what number do you actually use to do so?

570
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,830
Ninety-seven?

571
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,520
So, okay. So lower case A would be 97

572
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,840
and upper case A would be 65.

573
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,450
So this is kind of a nice chichi.

574
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,770
Now, once you know each of those,

575
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,800
you can now do 25 more upper case letters

576
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,500
and 25 more lower case letters

577
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,040
then there are some other stuff like

578
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,490
punctuation and things you see on the keyboard.

579
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,380
All of those do need their own encodings,

580
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,420
but at the end of the day, if you already knew coming

581
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,070
into this class that your computer stores information,

582
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,360
somehow, using zeros and ones,

583
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,070
well it turns out that if you have typed the letter A on your

584
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,530
keyboard and thus need to store that inside of your computer,

585
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,610
well, how do you actually go from numbers to that letter and back?

586
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:50,020
Well again, we can go to our ones column, twos, four, eight, 16,

587
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:57,000
damn, 32. So we can go to 32

588
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,370
and then we can go to 64, and then 128,

589
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,030
and this gives me 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

590
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,620
So this is intentional.

591
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,110
I now have eight columns, though sloppily written there,

592
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,200
eight columns or 8 bits.

593
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,500
So this is what we know as a byte.

594
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,100
You've probably been surrounded for years now by

595
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,000
bytes and kilobytes, and megabytes and terabytes, and the like.

596
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,450
Well, this is just a way of saying not bits,

597
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,990
but units of eight bits at a time.

598
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,230
Why is this useful?

599
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,230
Well one bit, really not all that useful,

600
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,470
two bits still not all that useful. Eight bits?

601
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,320
Starting to get useful because,

602
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,750
in fact with eight bits can you implement things like this?

603
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,690
So with eight bits can you express 256 possible characters?

604
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,330
That's pretty good 'cause now,

605
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,290
I can pretty much cover my American keyboard

606
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,110
pretty effectively both upper case, lower case, and a whole bunch

607
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,530
of punctuation. For other languages as in aside,

608
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,270
there are other encoding schemes when there are more characters.

609
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,910
So what would be the letter A in binary

610
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,690
inside of a computer's memory when you

611
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,170
hit the letter A on the keyboard, for capital A?

612
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:05,560
Zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, one.

613
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,980
And so this, in fact,

614
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,430
when you say your computer stores information as zeros and ones,

615
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,310
you've just typed the capital letter A,

616
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,370
that's all that's going on inside.

617
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,350
Now, how is that actually being implemented?

618
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,850
It actually depends on the technology.

619
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,950
You probably know your computer has something called RAM

620
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,940
which is where documents and programs live just temporarily

621
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,540
while you're running them 'cause RAM tends to be pretty fast

622
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,080
and whereas your hard disk is

623
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,360
where programs and files  live permanently.

624
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,380
You can pull the cord and your files should not

625
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,930
actually get deleted but the hard disks are—

626
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,950
use a different technology altogether.

627
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,450
But at the end of the day,

628
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,430
and here's why we just went with binary

629
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,080
and not decimal years ago,

630
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,760
when you have one implement a computer with a physical device,

631
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:51,190
it's actually really easy to represent the  notion of on or off.

632
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,320
Consider a light switch.

633
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,770
You can go on or you can go off and actually,

634
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,980
how about some gratuitous use of technology?

635
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,260
For those of you for--with iPhone 4,

636
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,710
by far, the most useful application for 99 cents

637
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,460
is this flashlight in the middle of the night.

638
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,900
So this might represent a one.

639
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,040
This now represents a zero. One, zero, one—

640
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,070
promise it gets more interesting,

641
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,970
zero. So why is this germane?

642
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,570
Well, if you're implementing a computer

643
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,000
that needs to represent information now all you need

644
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,610
is something like electricity

645
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,470
which can be on or off, on or off.

646
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,230
And when you actually wanna store information on disk,

647
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,930
can you actually use,

648
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,910
as we'll see in a moment, magnetic particles.

649
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,560
But just to hammer home this point,

650
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,000
if I could,

651
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,930
we have time for one awkward demonstration.

652
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,170
And for that I need a byte of volunteers, alright?

653
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,280
First eight hands that I saw we're roughly in here.

654
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,430
So come on up and I'll--okay,

655
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,560
one, two, three, four, five--five, six, seven, eight.

656
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,410
But you have to be comfortable on stage,

657
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,850
that's the catch 'cause this will be going out on the Internet.

658
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,570
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven—

659
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,850
sure, come on up,

660
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,730
and the eighth person to stand up right here.

661
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,260
Come on up. Okay.

662
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,930
So we now have a byte's worth of volunteers.

663
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,140
Why don't we use this side of the stage？

664
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,570
and I'll make some room for you.

665
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,110
You are the 128th's column, you're the 64's,

666
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,110
32's, 16's, 8's,

667
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,460
and we're gonna have to fix this slightly in a moment.

668
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,650
Otherwise the math is gonna get completely screwed up.

669
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,890
So if you guys could come over here

670
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,440
but still maintain your alignment

671
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,710
so 128 should be all the way over here and one, you should be

672
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,070
all the way over here and you guys similarly need to shuffle.

673
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,580
And if you wanna come up closer to the stage

674
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,990
where everyone can see you.

675
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,850
Alright! We now have a byte's worth of volunteers.

676
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,130
Now fortunately this time, it's not speaking role.

677
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,820
You just need to express in ASCII character, one at a time,

678
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,930
and these brave souls are simply going to

679
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,070
spell something out for us to hammer home this point of binary.

680
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,510
Now, each of you is essentially a place holder or a column.

681
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,330
Why don't we have you, when the time comes,

682
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,490
raise your hand if you're supposed to be representing a one?

683
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,530
So on, and or true, is another way we generally put this.

684
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,930
And if you're our zero just continue standing there awkwardly,

685
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,710
Alright. So with that said,

686
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,410
we have a three-letter word

687
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,700
so we'll have three rounds of hands going up or down.

688
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,390
On the back, they have a little chichi

689
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,920
that tells them what to do.

690
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,560
So folks [laughter], otherwise this gets really awkward

691
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,710
and really inaccurate quickly under pressure.

692
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:32,850
So go ahead, round one. That's okay.

693
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,320
So what number first are they presenting?

694
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,750
Sixty-six, right 'cause we've got one in the 64's column

695
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,660
and a one in the two's column, okay.

696
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,040
So now, a little chichi up top, they are representing the letter?

697
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,020
B.

698
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,040
Okay B. Alright, so a little pause,

699
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,850
just to let that sink in. Okay, round two,

700
00:31:52,290 --> 00:32:02,520
execute [laughter]. They really--it says on the back of your seat

701
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,490
what you should be doing. Alright,

702
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,580
what number are they representing now?

703
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,790
Seventy-nine. In fact, if you add up each of these numbers,

704
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,510
you should get the decimal number 79

705
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,970
from this binary number here.

706
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,390
Seventy-nine is, of course, the letter O so we're almost there.

707
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:24,160
Round three, go. And this spells?

708
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,450
No it shouldn't spell boy [laughter].

709
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,200
We have an error somewhere.

710
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,790
Its 87 if I did the math right myself,

711
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,570
87which is?

712
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,300
Bow.

713
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:48,210
Bow, so take your bow. Thank you very much.

714
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,350
Alright. That's the soon--we came a little better prepared

715
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,390
this time and we brought CS50 stress balls

716
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,240
for everyone to make this all the more of an incentive.

717
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,240
Oh, that was sweet. What a gift.

718
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,680
Oh--but if you can meet with our teaching fellows over there,

719
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,200
they're gonna ask the legal department to see you next so

720
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,140
Alright, I think we're all set.

721
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,730
Is that number eight?

722
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,090
Okay. Oh, you can keep that. You can keep that.

723
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,980
Okay. So what does—

724
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,800
how does that actually apply to real computers, right?

725
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:19,880
So this is not the most

726
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,200
efficient way of representing information.

727
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,190
What actually goes on underneath the hood?

728
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,520
Well, it turns out some of you might

729
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,560
recall this silly game from years ago.

730
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,060
Wooly Willy?

731
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,270
It turns out these are really hard to find in the 21st century.

732
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,060
So these things called Wooly Willy is just a plastic—

733
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,300
it's this paper mend with a plastic cover

734
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,950
and there's all these black magnetic particles here.

735
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,380
And if you use this little magnet

736
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,520
you can draw a mustache or hair, or eyebrows

737
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,620
or whatever on this particular face.

738
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,540
Now this is mostly irrelevant to what we're talking about

739
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,690
except for the fact that there are magnetic particles involved

740
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,510
and they're really small because it turns out

741
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,090
what's inside most of your laptops and desktop

742
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,230
computers are these things called hard drives.

743
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,730
And a hard drive, if you ever open that thing up,

744
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,450
is actually just a big metal container t

745
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,670
hat contains one or more platters,

746
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,890
so to speak, these circular pieces of metal

747
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,570
and on top of those circular pieces of metal are

748
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,970
essentially tiny little magnetic particles like this,

749
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,010
so small that you actually can't see them. But if you touch them

750
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,650
or open the hard drive and actually poke around,

751
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,260
you will do damage because you'll mangle these—

752
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,790
the alignment of these particles.

753
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,290
You'll corrupt your data.

754
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,600
But what's interesting is when they're actually there,

755
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,940
essentially, if this is a magnetic particle,

756
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,280
you can actually represent zeros and ones pretty easily.

757
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,920
You don't need a light switch

758
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,880
or a light bulb

759
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,760
or an iPhone app to turn something on or off.

760
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,810
You can take something that's magnetic with a north-south

761
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:46,350
magnetization and just say arbitrarily, this will represent one.

762
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,520
But if its south-north, this will represent zero.

763
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,280
So on your computer's hard drive are again, a whole bunch of

764
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,570
tiny magnetic particles aligned this way or this way.

765
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,820
And now that you have patterns of bits after bits after bits,

766
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,910
and if you chunk them up into say, eight-unit quantities,

767
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:06,580
now can you start storing words and sentences, and paragraphs.

768
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,080
And as we'll see mid semester,

769
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,810
photographs and videos and other

770
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,630
more sophisticated file formats.

771
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,810
It's one thing to talk about this.

772
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,120
Let me go ahead and open up instead

773
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,150
a more interesting graphical carnation--incarnation of this.

774
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,040
The hard drive is where your PC stores most of its permanent data.

775
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,690
To do that the data travels from RAM

776
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,450
along with software signals that tell the hard drive

777
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,430
how to store that data.

778
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,260
The hard drive circuits translate

779
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,800
those signals into to voltage fluctuations.

780
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,310
These in turn control the hard drive's moving parts.

781
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,640
Some of the few moving parts left in the modern computer.

782
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,020
Some of the signals control a motor

783
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,380
which spins metal-coded platters.

784
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,520
Your data is actually stored on these platters.

785
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,910
Other signals move the read/write heads to read

786
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,020
or write data on the platters.

787
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,200
This machinery is so precise that a human hair

788
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,320
couldn't even pass between the heads and spinning platters,

789
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,330
yet it all works in terrific speeds.

790
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,990
So if you've ever done something bad like drop your laptop or

791
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,010
smack your computer and you've never been told not to do this.

792
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,260
It's largely because—

793
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,070
and if you've never been, don't do this,

794
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,670
it's largely because there are these very sensitive

795
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,270
moving parts and there are relatively few moving parts

796
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,650
left in today's computers.

797
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,020
Some of you, in fact, might not even have these devices

798
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,610
anymore with moving parts.

799
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,960
The fan is perhaps the only thing left in those of you

800
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,480
who have computers with what are called SSDs.

801
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,240
But in hard drives where we actually have these moving platters,

802
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,290
here is in fact, how we get from electricity

803
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,910
and magnetism to those zeros and ones.

804
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,840
Let's look at what we just saw in slow motion.

805
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,340
When a brief pulse of electricity is sent to the read/write

806
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:53,310
head it flips on a tiny electromagnet for a fraction of a second.

807
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,830
The magnet creates a field which changes

808
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,340
the polarity of a tiny, tiny portion of the metal particles

809
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,530
which coat each platter's surface.

810
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,800
A patterned series of these tiny charged berries

811
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,210
on the disk represents a single bit of data in the

812
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,810
binary number system used by computers.

813
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,830
Now, if the current is sent one way through the read/write head

814
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,190
the area is polarized in one direction.

815
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,450
If the current is sent in the opposite direction,

816
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,350
the polarization is reversed.

817
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,830
How do you get data off the hard disk?

818
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,680
Just reverse the process.

819
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,430
So as the particles on the disk that get the

820
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,100
current in the read/write head moving put together

821
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,470
millions of these magnetized segments and you've got a file.

822
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,500
Now, the pieces of a single file may be scanning all the hard

823
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:38,210
drive's platters, patterns—the mess of papers on your desk.

824
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,980
So the special active file keeps track of whatever you missed.

825
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,150
Don't you wish that you had something like that?

826
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,170
Alright. So take it with a grain of salt.

827
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,900
It was made by a computer scientist,

828
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,810
but now, it's fun time.

829
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,520
So, these things here that you have in your hand,

830
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,450
is the results of my spontaneously going to staples before class.

831
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,260
I was the only one, believe it or not,

832
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,880
at the store, who was buying floppies today [laughter].

833
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,500
What you'll notice very delicately is that

834
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,380
there's not all that much to this so called floppy disk.

835
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,120
It's actually a much cheaper example

836
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,770
than handing out hard drives.

837
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:11,810
But at the end of the day,

838
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,580
if you move this metal thing aside with your fingers,

839
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,800
don't squeeze it too hard.

840
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,150
You will see inside that there's a platter,

841
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,390
but it's literally a floppy platter,

842
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,130
even though the disks themselves are fairly firm plastic.

843
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,130
This thing, if you now go ahead and

844
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,950
very gently corrupt a few of the bytes,

845
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,420
you can see that you can push down on that thing pretty easily.

846
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,380
Now--oh, now we've ruined them.

847
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,430
So why don't we go ahead and take this just a step further?

848
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,310
Go ahead and just pinch the metal plates and watch your eyes

849
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,050
'cause these do--things do have little springs.

850
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,140
Go ahead and just pull that metal plate off.

851
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:47,270
And now you truly can see that there's not much to this disk.

852
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,120
And then this is where you can really tear into this device.

853
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,350
If you put your fingers between

854
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,130
the plastic opening at the bottom,

855
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,690
and here's where you gotta watch out for the spring,

856
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:02,290
pull the thing apart and that's it.

857
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,990
The irony is--these things cost like a dollar

858
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,300
each now because no one needs them anymore.

859
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,660
It's kind of an Ec 10 thing there, but that's it.

860
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,400
So unfortunately, we had just ruined

861
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:20,450
roughly 1.4 million bytes worth of data.

862
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,930
They came formatted or blank so not such a big deal.

863
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,970
But in fact, if you just run your fingers again and again

864
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,180
over this floppy disk you are disorienting those

865
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,670
particles or knocking them off perhaps altogether,

866
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,560
depending on the medium.

867
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,060
And the rest of this thing, this is just a

868
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,860
cheap piece of molded plastic.

869
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,060
This little felt thing there is just to avoid

870
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,880
too much friction from building up with the

871
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,900
plastic or to keep it slightly separated from the case,

872
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,310
but that's it. That's all there was to

873
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,290
those things called floppy disks.

874
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,360
But what's amazing is that the hard drives we have today

875
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,240
in a desktop or in a laptop,

876
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,640
a hard drive and a laptop is only about--yey big!

877
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,600
It's roughly the same size physically as those floppy disks

878
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,020
and yet how many, how much, how many bytes

879
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,780
fit on a typical hard drive today?

880
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:13,480
What's that 500, so 500 megabytes, this is 1.4 megabytes

881
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,100
so a typical hard drive might have 500—

882
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,560
no, not 500 megabyte, 500 gigabytes

883
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,820
which is 500 billion bytes

884
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,350
and if you have a desktop computer

885
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,990
you might actually have a 1 terabyte drive or 1.5 terabyte drive

886
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:31,150
or 1--2.0 terabyte drive. These are trillions now of bytes.

887
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,400
And so it wasn't all that many years ago frankly that you know,

888
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,550
certainly, people in this class were still using these things.

889
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,450
Thankfully, they've fallen into disuse.

890
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,210
They're not the most robust things anymore.

891
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,090
But the technology and the fundamentals and the ideas,

892
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,050
it's pretty much exactly the same as

893
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,420
we're using today in some of our modern computers.

894
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:57,290
So, any questions on zeroes and ones?

895
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,210
It's a little awkward asking questions in here

896
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,320
but let's give it a try.

897
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,950
Good question, so what happens when you format

898
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,050
a floppy disk or format a hard drive?

899
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,310
To be honest, not very much

900
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:13,410
and this is one of the reasons that forensic investigators

901
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,320
are actually able to do such a good job for the police and FBI

902
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,660
or the like because so many computer programs,

903
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:19,840
Mac OS and Windows,

904
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,080
they'll say, are you sure you want to do this,

905
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,190
this will erase everything from your disk,

906
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,850
this will erase everything from your hard drive

907
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,810
if you so called format it or partition it.

908
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,400
It's another piece of jargon you often hear.

909
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,220
That generally is just modifying a few bytes,

910
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,640
a few kilobytes worth of information.

911
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,260
The end result of which is that the computer

912
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,280
forgets where all of your files and folders are.

913
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,890
But the bits that actually compose those files

914
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:48,860
and folders are in fact exactly where you left them.

915
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,340
And so this is why in problem set 5 last year

916
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,040
when I took photographs on campus with a compact flash card,

917
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,810
just standard consumer media and I accidentally formatted that

918
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,550
compact flash card, I only lost the first few kilobytes, the

919
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,640
first few thousand bits on that compact flash card.

920
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,510
But as you probably know, a JPEG, a photograph,

921
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,640
these are usually multiple megabytes

922
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,820
these days which means there's a

923
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,840
ridiculous amount of data still on that digital camera.

924
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,300
And so if you know what patterns of zeroes

925
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,420
and ones to look for as you will yourselves

926
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,770
this year in that forensics problem set,

927
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,980
can you recover a lot of that data?

928
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,650
So in short, formatting a disk

929
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,180
gets it ready for new data

930
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,230
but it tends not to get rid of the old

931
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,990
and only recently are Apple and Microsoft finally realizing

932
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,890
that consumers actually want to securely erase

933
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,790
their information for privacy or financial or whatever reasons,

934
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,920
but up until now and even know on some

935
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,310
operating systems it's not in fact very easy,

936
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,430
other questions. Yeah.

937
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,820
Exactly, so you might have been thought

938
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,600
especially in years past to defragment,

939
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,300
so to speak, your hard drive once in a while.

940
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,440
And this is because as you start writing--saving files to your

941
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,620
hard drive, what happens is you might save this file here,

942
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,370
then this one, then this one, then this one,

943
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,010
but very reasonably you might go back

944
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,510
eventually and delete this one.

945
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,390
Now you have a gap in your data

946
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,400
and yet you still have some magnetic

947
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,580
particles there that could be useful.

948
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,850
So thankfully, modern operating systems allow you

949
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,550
to put parts of files here,

950
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,690
parts of your file here,

951
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,160
parts of your file here,

952
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,170
but the end result is that your files get fragmented.

953
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,850
The operating system still finds it but this process of getting

954
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,890
some of your files bits from here, some from here, some from here,

955
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,210
induces a potential slow down.

956
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,320
Now defragmentation as an aside is not so much necessary

957
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:42,740
these days because hardware has gotten so performance.

958
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,240
But it is in fact indicative of what's actually going on

959
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:49,090
underneath the hood and for a forensic investigator to be honest

960
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,500
and even problem set 5,

961
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,610
it poses a potential wrinkle if those JPEGs,

962
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,850
those photos we took are not contiguous

963
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,740
back to back to back but are all over the place.

964
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,880
That's a lot harder of a problem to solve

965
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,790
if you need to reconstruct the fragmentation, yeah.

966
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,350
Good question, so there is this little reading head

967
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,060
kind of like in an old phonograph player

968
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,220
that does move back and forth and in and out

969
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,600
depending on the implementation.

970
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,020
So there is generally a little computer,

971
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,020
a circuit board in the hard drive itself

972
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,430
that knows how to tell it to go up, down, left, right and so forth.

973
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,030
And if you've ever heard the word driver software

974
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,640
that you install in your computer so that your computer,

975
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,860
your operating system,

976
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,900
Windows or Mac OS,

977
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,160
knows how to talk to that piece of hardware,

978
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,200
it's that driver software that then empowers the operating

979
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,180
systems to send those commands as well, up,

980
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,310
down, left, right depending on how the disk—

981
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,840
the data is laid out on the disk.

982
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,520
Let me go over here for another question.

983
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,860
Okay, what are the advantages of SSDs and how do they work.

984
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,960
Let me answer this briefly now,

985
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,420
I'm happy to chat more during break time.

986
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,120
SSDs are where things are going.

987
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,410
SSDs is like using compact flash or SD cards.

988
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,180
The things we've had in cameras for several

989
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,890
years by putting gigabytes,

990
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,950
soon hopefully terabytes of storage on

991
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,750
a device that has no moving parts.

992
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,800
Generally, the feature is that they are much faster

993
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:14,200
because they have no moving parts.

994
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,700
Even though a hard drive spins at 7200 times per minute

995
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:21,200
or even faster, that's relatively slower than the speed of light.

996
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,030
And so when you actually have a device

997
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,720
that is purely electronic, and even that doesn't—

998
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,780
the bits don't flow at the speed of light in reality.

999
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,590
It's a lot faster of a device.

1000
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,650
But these days you pay for it which is why you get SSDs,

1001
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,030
you're paying several hundred dollars more.

1002
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,790
So let's transition from these lower level details.

1003
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,170
I'm happy to take questions during break

1004
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,680
and after to actually making this

1005
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:44,600
hardware do something in software.

1006
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,540
And for this I need one volunteer.

1007
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,520
Let's go and okay, right here.

1008
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,890
Oh, but let's see.

1009
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,640
Okay, I need a second volunteer for reasons

1010
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:57,750
that will be clear in a second.

1011
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,610
Come on down. Your role has just been changed

1012
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,300
because you're not wearing any socks today.

1013
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,500
So come on over here, we're gonna have--what's your name?

1014
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,090
Sam.

1015
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,330
Sam and?

1016
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:13,170
Philip.

1017
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,270
Sam and Philip. Alright, I'm David

1018
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,060
and let's have Philip sit down.

1019
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,270
You'll play role sort of a shoe salesman, shall we say?

1020
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,550
Okay.

1021
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,810
Alright, and don't worry I have a

1022
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,890
script for you but not for Philip.

1023
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:25,070
So here is a computer program.

1024
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,180
This is not written in a particular language.

1025
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,420
This is what's written in what we'll generally call pseudocode.

1026
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,890
Pseudocode is kind of an English-like syntax

1027
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,150
that's just a useful way of

1028
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,310
expressing yourself fairly succinctly,

1029
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,180
fairly computer-like but without having

1030
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,560
to worry about stupid details

1031
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,580
like whether it's Java or C or whatever.

1032
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,020
You just kind of say what you mean but you say it succinctly.

1033
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,310
But what's interesting about this

1034
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,370
particular example is

1035
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,920
one, it's imperfect.

1036
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,900
I didn't quite get this program right.

1037
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:54,170
Two, it also highlights a number of constructs that we'll see

1038
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,650
today and we'll see recurring throughout this world of

1039
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,880
programming, things like loops and conditions and variables and

1040
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,200
the like. So what we have Philip here for

1041
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,220
is to actually be the one who if you could start taking off your

1042
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,310
shoes and socks,

1043
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,020
I didn't just claim this in the beginning

1044
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,210
but we very quickly in this course start

1045
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:17,760
to hemorrhage volunteers overtime. Alright.

1046
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,910
You don't have to--you don't have to touch.

1047
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,340
It's okay. So this first line of code,

1048
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,530
I will get it started but then I'm gonna have you take over

1049
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,310
and actually instruct Philip what to do here.

1050
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,720
So this first line of code,

1051
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,140
and some of this again we'll be rehashed

1052
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,300
but at least you can delight in the

1053
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,810
awkwardness that is this demonstration.

1054
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,330
So line 1, I've numbered the lines

1055
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,490
just for the sake of discussion.

1056
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,620
Line 1 is creating what we'll call a variable.

1057
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,810
Now, unlike high school math or in algebra

1058
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,630
where you call things X and Y and Z,

1059
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,070
in programming, in computer science,

1060
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,000
you're actually dealing with humans

1061
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,660
where it's useful to have a variable name

1062
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,440
that's more descriptive than X and Y and Z.

1063
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,660
So here is an example of socks on feet being

1064
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,540
the number of socks on Philip's feet which is in fact 0.

1065
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,380
On line 2, we're gonna induce what's called a loop,

1066
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,440
so do you wanna go ahead

1067
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,300
and Philip  henceforth you get to stare,

1068
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,890
stare at the awkwardness.

1069
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:09,370
Go ahead and recite for us line 2 of this program.

1070
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,760
Okay, so while not equal to, so bang equals, exclamation point

1071
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,280
equals is computer science syntax for saying not equal to,

1072
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:23,530
while not equal to 2 which it is not, it is equal to 0.

1073
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:24,790
What should he do next?

1074
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,750
Okay.

1075
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,110
Excellent, look for sock, alright.

1076
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,690
Step 5, now this is an example of what we'll henceforth call a

1077
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,850
condition or a branch because it's sort of a fork in the road.

1078
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,050
Okay, if you find the sock then put on sock.

1079
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:54,280
Intentionally, I bought the worst socks I could.

1080
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,840
No, I like it.

1081
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,250
I get this.

1082
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:07,640
Available at the Harvard Coop. Alright, next line.

1083
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,480
Socks on feet plus plus.

1084
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,500
So this plus plus is sort of shorthand notation for

1085
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,450
incrementation. So just add 1 to this variable's value,

1086
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,280
so now socks on feet is of course 1 and so next.

1087
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:20,730
Look for matching sock.

1088
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:25,990
Problem, so where are we at line 9?

1089
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,580
If you find a matching sock

1090
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,820
which you didn't so then else.

1091
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,920
Okay, so notice again the control flow and this—

1092
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,980
the choice of indentation here is deliberate throughout

1093
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,740
programming whether it's in C or

1094
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,840
PHP or JavaScript in this particular course.

1095
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,830
The indentation gives you a visual cue

1096
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,050
as to which lines are related to each other.

1097
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,450
So the fact that line 9 did not match,

1098
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,000
if you find a matching sock which we didn't,

1099
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,750
that means we immediately jump to the else

1100
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,830
which is line 13 and so Philip now has to do what?

1101
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,630
Remove first sock from foot.

1102
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,840
Oh man!

1103
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:01,250
Socks on feet, minus minus.

1104
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:02,980
We decrement so to speak the variable and then

1105
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,130
where will we go next in terms of the flow control,

1106
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,100
the flow of this program.

1107
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,000
Back to the while.

1108
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,470
Right, so the fact that everything is indented means while

1109
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,380
we're doing, while the variable is not equal to 2,

1110
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,590
keep doing this.

1111
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,220
And so we're going to repeat.

1112
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,730
Now, rather than  go through this again and again,

1113
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,200
because frankly you can probably see where

1114
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,290
this goes before long we're gonna hit some problems.

1115
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,110
What's one of the problems you see

1116
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,510
or that we tripped over already?

1117
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,470
If there is no matching socks then

1118
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,600
what's gonna happen with Philip here?

1119
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,660
We're gonna have a so called a loop,

1120
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,370
an infinite loop and you actually

1121
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,660
experience this in the real world.

1122
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,110
If you've ever been using some program,

1123
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,780
you did something completely innocuous,

1124
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,600
pull something down from a menu, click a button,

1125
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,420
you didn't do anything wrong and yet

1126
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,400
all  of a sudden the thing just starts hanging there

1127
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,100
or you get a little spinning beach ball

1128
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:51,580
or the hour glass or whatever it is.

1129
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:54,410
Something completely not your fault, it's not.

1130
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,600
It's because the programmer or programmers

1131
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,870
that wrote that software might have been pretty specific

1132
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,610
but not specific enough.

1133
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,970
Computers smart though they may be and

1134
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,340
intimidating though they may be,

1135
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,900
they cannot yet think for themselves.

1136
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,640
They can't just know what you mean.

1137
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,950
And so similarly as Gmail's priority inbox,

1138
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,680
it's gonna be pretty flawed for a lot  of us at least initially

1139
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:17,310
because it just doesn't know the answers a priori correctly

1140
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:20,640
unless we teach it or program it to be better. There is also

1141
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,780
another flaw in here or multiple flaws arguably.

1142
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,980
But something else catch your eye?

1143
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,960
This is a very imperfect program.

1144
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,950
So, in fact we may not find a sock at all

1145
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,280
and yet we don't seem to handle that at all

1146
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,380
unless if we don't find any socks, what do we do?

1147
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,690
We replenish the sock drawer.

1148
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,740
So if we tease this apart and this is actually nice,

1149
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,780
every semester I get beat up for just how bad this thing

1150
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,830
actually is if you start really picking it apart.

1151
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,160
You find that there's a lot of flaws

1152
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:51,350
but this is intentional

1153
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:54,060
and this is one of the sort of arts that you learn early on

1154
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,630
is that with computers you really do need to be careful

1155
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,930
and you need to think about this so called corner cases

1156
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,450
and even you might use popular websites or programs

1157
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:04,230
that have so called bugs or mistakes and that is

1158
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,100
simply the results of the programmer not having

1159
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,500
anticipated some particular problem.

1160
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,120
So we have a parting gift.

1161
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,710
Why don't we give Philip both the matching pair

1162
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,470
and give you each a pair of socks

1163
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,180
since he didn't get to  wear this one,

1164
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,350
they are brand new, in fact,

1165
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,370
and a big round of applause

1166
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,440
for what I'm sure is a little difficult.

1167
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:34,200
Take your time. So, let's actually now take a 2-minute break,

1168
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,990
we're gonna change tapes and we'll come back

1169
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,980
and we'll actually write programs with a real computer

1170
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,670
and some real animated characters.

1171
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,140
More in just a couple of minutes.

1172
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:51,590
Alright, we are back so we just wrote a programming

1173
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,340
pseudocode or walk through a programming pseudocode.

1174
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,970
Let's take a quick glimpse of what it's like

1175
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,040
to write a real program albeit a very trivial one.

1176
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:02,610
Starting next week you'll actually be using a cluster

1177
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,200
of systems that CS50 itself runs called Cloud.CS50.net.

1178
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,240
This is a bunch of computers running an operating system

1179
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,880
called Linux which has a variety of interfaces too

1180
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,190
and more on that next week.

1181
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,720
But it turns out that on Macs

1182
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,350
and if you have the right software on PCs,

1183
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,680
you can  kind of get a teaser of what this environment

1184
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,560
tends to look like and be forewarned, what you're about to see

1185
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,820
is intentionally very underwhelming.

1186
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,090
I am going to run a program called Nano

1187
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,740
and type nano hello.c

1188
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:30,820
and I'm gonna type the following very quickly

1189
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,340
without much explanation

1190
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:34,870
because we'll dive into this more next week.

1191
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,360
But what I'm doing here is programming.

1192
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:43,290
Sorry, I didn't mean to make it sound so condescending.

1193
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,840
>> So this is just a dumb text editor called Nano,

1194
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,750
dumb in that it's very simple which is nice

1195
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,810
because it eliminates a lot of the complexities of learning a

1196
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,560
new tool when really all you wanna do is solve an actual problem.

1197
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,520
So I'm gonna go ahead and save this file,

1198
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,910
it's hello.c,

1199
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:00,110
dot C hints at the fact that this program

1200
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,390
I just whipped up is written in a language called C.

1201
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,540
Now, this is underwhelming with what you can do

1202
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,540
in just a second in this particular language.

1203
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,510
But again as per Wednesday's lecture by the end of the semester,

1204
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,520
you'll be making things like isawyouharvard.com

1205
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,620
or any websites really that you can imagine.

1206
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,890
Can you probably produce after

1207
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,960
just several weeks of fundamentals like these?

1208
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:22,430
So I'm saving this file,

1209
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,790
notice there is a few keywords

1210
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,080
that we'll come back to next week

1211
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,170
like main which is kind of the main part of my program.

1212
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,700
There is this include which allows me to include code,

1213
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,100
source code so to speak that other people wrote

1214
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,830
so I don't have to figure out for myself

1215
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:36,320
how to print things to the screen.

1216
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:37,980
Other people are telling me how to—

1217
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,260
other people had solved that problem for me,

1218
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,850
and this thing between quotes, we'll start calling a string.

1219
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,540
It's just a sentence or words or whatever that I wanna print.

1220
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,110
And then there are some stupid syntax

1221
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:48,880
like curly braces and semicolons

1222
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,530
that initially are kind of annoying

1223
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,430
because you have to remember where all this junk goes.

1224
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:55,250
But at the end of the day, it's really going to be

1225
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,490
identical to what we see pictorially with Scratch.

1226
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,880
I'm now gonna run a program called GCC

1227
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,480
which is what's called the compiler.

1228
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,600
Compiler, we'll also revisit next week takes—

1229
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:08,500
human text, ASCII text as input and output zeroes

1230
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:13,830
and ones that represent that program in a manner that the CPU,

1231
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:17,190
the Intel Inside, actually understands which is—

1232
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:22,000
interesting, dammit, not installed on this computer.

1233
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,880
So what we would see,

1234
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,610
I'm going to completely fake this,

1235
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,660
is a program that operates like that.

1236
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,250
So I just realized this is a new MacBook Pro

1237
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,170
that I didn't actually download the compiler onto it apparently.

1238
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,740
So good, that will give us something to do next week.

1239
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,610
But what you would have seen is the program just doing this,

1240
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,170
printing out to the screen.

1241
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,430
But unfortunately, this is incredibly

1242
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,810
underwhelming certainly in the first week of a course.

1243
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:48,750
It's much more interesting if you can actually

1244
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:51,950
build things that are interactive, that are animated,

1245
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:55,170
that play music and so forth and not just produce things on day

1246
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,650
1 that outputs zeroes and ones like this.

1247
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,950
So those are in fact the patterns of zeroes and ones,

1248
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,400
the bytes that would have been outputted had I

1249
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,070
remembered to download the compiler to this computer

1250
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,860
and run it on that little hello.c file.

1251
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,490
But we'll do that again correctly next time.

1252
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,230
But it turns out that with this

1253
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,830
language we glimpsed on Wednesday,

1254
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,650
you can do the step so much more easily

1255
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,520
and yet the ideas are identical to what

1256
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,240
we're gonna explore at a lower level in the weeks to come.

1257
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:23,460
So this is the simplest program you can

1258
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:26,010
probably write in this language called Scratch.

1259
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,540
Scratch is a program that you can download for free

1260
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,540
and you will see in problem set 0

1261
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,080
which will be posted on CS50.nettonight

1262
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,620
under problem sets in both standard and hacker editions,

1263
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,680
can you do the--can you--it will walk you

1264
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:41,500
through the process of getting this software.

1265
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,610
This software now looks like this.

1266
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:46,270
On the top right hand side is the so called stage.

1267
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,000
This is where as we saw on Wednesday

1268
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,340
are sprites or our characters.

1269
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,720
Our little characters are going to play

1270
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,250
or move as we instruct them to do.

1271
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:59,160
On the left hand side is my palette of puzzle

1272
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,220
pieces or building blocks and those are the things.

1273
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,220
In a moment, I'm gonna drag and drop in order to

1274
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,060
induce this right to do something.

1275
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,580
And in the middle of this blank slate, in the middle,

1276
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,910
this is where my program is going to go.

1277
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,710
And so as we saw on Wednesday,

1278
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,350
if I wanna just get this thing started,

1279
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:17,020
notice that there is this thing here when green flag clicked,

1280
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,440
that scratches version of that keyword "main".

1281
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,870
So main is equivalent to this green flag.

1282
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,050
What can I now do?

1283
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,320
We'll shape like a puzzle piece

1284
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:28,520
that will allow me to go to the looks palette at top left

1285
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,020
and it's pretty self-explanatory.

1286
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,720
The categories, the colors, very quickly start to

1287
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,420
make sense when you just start poking around.

1288
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:38,220
I'm gonna drag this thing here, zoom in, and voila,

1289
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,570
what do I now see?

1290
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,840
Well, I now have two blocks interlocked

1291
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,210
and you can pretty much guess what this is gonna do.

1292
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:48,780
It's going to say hello and I can change this here.

1293
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,040
I can change the number of seconds that it does it.

1294
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,940
And if I want to detach it, I just click and drag,

1295
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,350
and now I can go back and put

1296
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,470
different puzzle pieces there altogether.

1297
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,400
But it turns out though simple, though,

1298
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,410
some of these puzzle pieces actually are,

1299
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,580
we can actually start to do very

1300
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,670
interesting things very quickly.

1301
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,160
So, some jargon first.

1302
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:08,940
Computers generally have things

1303
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,420
called--computer languages

1304
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,390
generally have things called "statements".

1305
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,690
A statement is an action.

1306
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,750
It's an instruction.

1307
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:18,280
It's a capability that just tells the computer what to do.

1308
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,960
Much as you might instruct as a human, a robot,

1309
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,650
to do something to the extent that's currently possible.

1310
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,480
So say, "Oh, hi world."

1311
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,160
This would be called a statement.

1312
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:29,250
Another one might be "wait one second"

1313
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:31,950
which is another building block or puzzle piece and scratch.

1314
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,710
And another one might be "play sound meow."

1315
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,480
So now you can start to see the things

1316
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:38,230
can get interesting quickly.

1317
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,630
Well, let's go ahead and do that.

1318
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:43,150
Let me go ahead and open up some of the examples that I came with.

1319
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,810
All of these are available on the courses'

1320
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,550
website so you can play afterward.

1321
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,390
And I'm gonna go ahead and open a file called

1322
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:52,460
hai2.sb which is the file extension for this language.

1323
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:53,900
Now, notice in the middle,

1324
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,350
I wrote this at home already,

1325
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:58,280
you can pretty much read this stuff top to

1326
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:59,630
bottom to see what it does.

1327
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,100
When green flag clicked,

1328
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,000
I'm gonna say, "Oh, hi world for a second",

1329
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:05,350
then wait, say it again and wait,

1330
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,260
say it again, and then that's it.

1331
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,270
So let's go ahead and click the green flag.

1332
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,480
And in fact, very overwhelming.

1333
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,850
So let's actually start to make this more interesting.

1334
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,810
Let me go ahead and instead open up what I called high3.

1335
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,490
I'm gonna go ahead and say don't say it '

1336
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,150
cause I didn't make any changes. I'll play this--

1337
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,530
Okay, getting cute.

1338
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:33,550
You do that on loop too long,

1339
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:34,990
it gets really annoying quickly.

1340
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,880
[Laughter] But it's just a different statement.

1341
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,390
And so when you start to poke around the puzzle pieces,

1342
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:41,780
you see that it can say things,

1343
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,620
we'll see movement in just a moment and sound and so forth, but

1344
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,990
at the end of the day, this is just like the program we used

1345
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,050
a moment ago for the sock exercise

1346
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,130
where we just hold Philip a step after step after step, do this,

1347
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:54,140
do this, do that, and yet, here too,

1348
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,400
we already see an opportunity for that thing we called the loop.

1349
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:01,490
I am meowing three times and you can very quick--easily see

1350
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,580
perhaps that this very quickly could get messy.

1351
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,860
I could do a whole lot of copy-paste essentially.

1352
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,730
If I want the cat meow six times,

1353
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,290
I just make a copy of this which you can do

1354
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,490
by right-clicking or control-clicking as you'll see,

1355
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,210
and then I just keep doing this and this, and this, and this,

1356
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,840
but now, what's the problem?

1357
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:18,610
Well, one, it just starts to look ridiculous, frankly.

1358
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:21,700
You should acquire overtime this instinctive aversion to just

1359
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,740
code or programs that just look ugly because things that look

1360
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:28,180
ugly generally are not easy to maintain.

1361
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,980
For instance, if I wanted to change the

1362
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,570
sound that the cat is making,

1363
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,770
my God, now I have to change it on three places

1364
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,840
but like 30 places if all I've done is copy and paste.

1365
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,980
So hopefully, there's an opportunity for actually

1366
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:42,380
looping and, ultimately, than doing things conditionally.

1367
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,660
So if you wanna do something conditionally,

1368
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,520
you generally needs to ask the question,

1369
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:48,760
is the following true or false.

1370
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:50,120
In Philip's case, we ask the question,

1371
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,550
does he have zero or none zero socks on his feet?

1372
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,730
Or rather, does he have two or not two socks on his feet?

1373
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,090
That's what's called a Boolean expression named

1374
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,150
after literally a man named Boole.

1375
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:05,210
And this puzzle piece here colored in blue

1376
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,080
because it's a Boolean expression

1377
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:10,820
is just something that--whose answer is either a yes or no,

1378
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,780
true or false, one or zero.

1379
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,440
So notice already the parallels between the lower

1380
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,520
level details and now these higher level details,

1381
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,290
so to speak, of actually programming.

1382
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,970
This Boolean expression allows you to say to scratch

1383
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,190
if you are touching the mouse pointer, the little arrow,

1384
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,620
do something. How do we do something?

1385
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,720
We'll see in a moment.

1386
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:32,730
What else can you detect as a yes or no answer is the mouse down?

1387
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,910
Yes or no. That can give you a true or false,

1388
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,090
a one or a zero answer. What about this?

1389
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,780
Is the number on the left less than the number on the right?

1390
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:43,840
That might be a question you might wanna answer

1391
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,340
or you might wanna say,

1392
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:51,180
is the thing on the left and the thing on the right both true?

1393
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,190
Do I have two yes answers if you wanna

1394
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:55,410
check two conditions at once? You know, this might seem to be

1395
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:58,540
a bit of a new context for some of you

1396
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,970
but consider a typical website.

1397
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,560
If you've been shopping for courses on Harvard courses,

1398
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,230
the website we mentioned on Wednesday,

1399
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,910
well, you'll notice you'll recall perhaps that there's

1400
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:11,010
all these checkboxes, all these checkboxes that allow you to,

1401
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:13,030
say, you want a course in the fall or the spring,

1402
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,110
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, well, now,

1403
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,950
think about even with today's basics already in mind,

1404
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:21,760
that this is just kind of the same idea where if you wanna look

1405
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:24,470
for a course that's on the fall and on Monday, Tuesday,

1406
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:29,250
that's like saying I want fall and Monday, and Tuesday,

1407
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,760
so each of these checkboxes

1408
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,800
is itself, really, a Boolean expression.

1409
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,380
And so you see that stuff all over the place

1410
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:36,730
on Facebook, Google, and the like.

1411
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,310
These are not foreign concepts.

1412
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:41,450
It's just we're now slapping some new, perhaps jargon on them.

1413
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:44,430
Now that you have the ability to ask yes or no questions,

1414
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,950
you wanna be able to branch or

1415
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,690
fork in the road based on those answers.

1416
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,990
We saw this with the sock algorithm a moment ago.

1417
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,400
In scratch, a condition looks a little something like this.

1418
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:56,150
It's a puzzle piece that looks kind of small

1419
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,410
but notice there is this little funky shape up top

1420
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,200
that's the same shape as the blue blocks we've just looked at

1421
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:03,860
'cause you can drag and drop that condition on top of that,

1422
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:06,170
and even though there's not much space in the middle here,

1423
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,000
it turns out what's nice about scratches,

1424
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:10,850
it will grow to fill more and more puzzle pieces.

1425
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,250
If you just drag them and drag them, and drag them in there, it

1426
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,900
will keep growing to fill--to fit any such statements.

1427
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,010
And you don't just have to have

1428
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,630
and if or nothing construct.

1429
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,340
You can say if this is true,

1430
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,730
then go and do the following pieces of code or puzzle pieces

1431
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,260
that are inside this part of the block,

1432
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,210
else go ahead and do these that are down here.

1433
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:31,480
And we saw this with Philip's example.

1434
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,350
But sometimes there are three roads you can take

1435
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:35,990
and so even though it starts to look a little messy,

1436
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,390
if you do this too much,

1437
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:39,770
you can certainly branch this way or this way,

1438
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:43,490
or this way and these are what we generally call conditions.

1439
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:48,030
Well, let's actually put these to use. Here's high4.sb.

1440
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:54,110
Kind of a stupid program, why?

1441
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,730
Right. So this is a great way of like fulfilling

1442
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,150
the requirements of the problem step

1443
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,320
but not quite the spirit of using a condition.

1444
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,080
So this is not all that interesting,

1445
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,130
but let's actually take a look at a 5th version of high

1446
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,150
that actually does something interesting.

1447
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,680
Oh, it turns out there's a puzzle piece

1448
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,460
that allows you to pick a random

1449
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:16,070
or as we'll start calling it soon a pseudorandom number

1450
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,810
so that scratch can effectively roll

1451
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:20,550
a dice or flip a coin,

1452
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,750
or give you a bit of non-determinism.

1453
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,160
It's the fancy way of saying this.

1454
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:25,770
And this is useful because if you're actually

1455
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,200
writing a program that's interactive or that you want

1456
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:30,510
to change overtime much like you would a game,

1457
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:34,190
hopefully, the game is not going to have the bad guys,

1458
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,690
for instance, always standing in the same place or the rocks

1459
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:40,000
or whatever it is falling from the sky in the same place

1460
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,660
'cause it would very quickly become a very tedious game.

1461
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,980
Almost any game you play has some kind of

1462
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,830
randomness or pseudorandomness which means that

1463
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:51,050
things change overtime somewhat unpredictably.

1464
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,120
So now, if I click the green flag,

1465
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:58,360
the program seems broken or--I don't know.

1466
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:00,340
It's just the number that was picked between 1 and 10

1467
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:03,420
that's probably bigger than 5 or 6, not smaller.

1468
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:07,470
Let's try it again. Let's try it again.

1469
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:10,360
There we go. Now if I do this,

1470
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,950
an infinite number of times,

1471
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,320
we should get roughly 50/50,

1472
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:19,340
but now we have the ability to do things only once in awhile.

1473
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,170
So now, loops.

1474
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:22,660
You wanna do something again and again.

1475
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:24,090
You can kind of see where the syntax

1476
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:25,620
is going, looks like a loop,

1477
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,740
but you can kind of put blocks inside of you,

1478
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,730
and the little arrow suggests that once you get to the bottom

1479
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,640
just like our socks example, you're gonna do the following again.

1480
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,190
What else might it look like?

1481
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:37,080
You might be able to say and we'll see this in C and PHP as well.

1482
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:38,900
Do the following a bunch of times,

1483
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,700
but a finite number of times which might be useful.

1484
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:43,320
So here we have a repeat block.

1485
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,900
Let's actually put this into play with

1486
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:46,710
the little sprite known as scratch.

1487
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,600
So this is high6.

1488
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:50,130
And now, as promised,

1489
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,260
and all even full screen, it's really annoying.

1490
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,720
If we weren't so pressed for time,

1491
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,190
I kinda wanna see how long we could get away

1492
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:05,670
with this before it gets awkward,

1493
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,790
but [laughter] that, in fact, is an infinite loop t

1494
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,600
hat's hopefully deliberate.

1495
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,890
Otherwise, it's a pretty bad mistake,

1496
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:15,160
but sometimes you do want an infinite loop,

1497
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,100
for instance, Microsoft Word if you use it

1498
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,010
or pages or the like on your Mac or PC.

1499
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,880
These days those things constantly spell

1500
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,340
check your program for you.

1501
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,320
So in a sense,

1502
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:26,540
that's a good infinite loop

1503
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:27,910
that is as long as you're using the program,

1504
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:30,260
it's constantly checking your grammar and spelling,

1505
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,690
and underlining things,

1506
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,640
so infinite loops aren't necessarily bad

1507
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:36,560
if the objective is actually being met.

1508
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,930
Well, let's take a look at this high7 variant

1509
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:43,530
that also use loops that also uses a loop. So this one is a little

1510
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,930
cute, I like to think. So notice this.

1511
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:47,420
My mouse cursor is over here on the top right,

1512
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,280
now, I touch the cat.

1513
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:53,030
Move away.

1514
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:55,670
So this is my--petting a cat, example.

1515
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:57,250
Well, how does this work?

1516
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:59,240
We'll notice, it's just a few puzzle pieces.

1517
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,560
I'm forever watching the situation.

1518
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:04,420
And now, if I'm touching mouse pointer,

1519
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,050
we saw that Boolean expression before,

1520
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,340
play sound meow,

1521
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:08,900
wait a couple of seconds,

1522
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,040
and then just keep checking.

1523
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:11,100
So if I left my cursor there

1524
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,340
like you're petting the cat,

1525
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,220
it would just keep meowing and meowing every two seconds,

1526
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,480
but if I move it away, that Boolean expression

1527
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,440
becomes false or zero and so we don't do it again.

1528
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:20,620
And just to be clear,

1529
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:22,140
you can disassemble these programs,

1530
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,690
you can move this thing over here.

1531
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,760
It's all about dragging and dropping which is,

1532
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:27,040
to say, is very intuitive.

1533
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,040
If you think of the idea,

1534
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,280
you think of the basic logic,

1535
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,470
and then you go ahead and drag and drop accordingly.

1536
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:33,350
Let's look at this 8th variance of this,

1537
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,080
otherwise, simple example.

1538
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,190
Well, this one was me having a little fun here. So play--

1539
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,860
Cat meows ad nauseam.

1540
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:46,500
But touch the cat and--[sound effects] [laughter].

1541
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:48,610
So don't touch this particular cat.

1542
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,290
So how is this working?

1543
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,840
Well, again, I'm not spending too much time

1544
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:54,580
on the specifics because again, it should hopefully start—it

1545
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,340
was, oh, that's kind of intuitive.

1546
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,960
If something is true do this,

1547
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,810
else something is true, do that.

1548
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,580
Well, what are some of the other constructs we're

1549
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,680
gonna have access to starting with scratch and see?

1550
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:06,020
Well, certainly, variables.

1551
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,520
If you want to maintain states,

1552
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,450
that is, to say, remember some value,

1553
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:11,100
well, you can use what's called a variable

1554
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:13,470
and here's what it looks like in this language called scratch.

1555
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,230
Now, who cares about variables Xs and Ys and all these? Well,

1556
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:18,350
what about a game?

1557
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:19,910
Anything where you're actually keeping track of something

1558
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:21,770
like a score that's having a variable that you increment

1559
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,660
plus, plus, or decrement, minus, minus, using the

1560
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,100
appropriate puzzle piece could certainly be compelling.

1561
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,940
Suppose you want a character to move

1562
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:32,020
around the screen and collect things.

1563
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:33,370
So it doesn't make sense to just use

1564
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,030
a number 'cause you wantthis character

1565
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:37,430
to collect something from here or here,or there.

1566
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:38,950
Well, you can use what's called an array

1567
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:41,710
which is kind of a list or a little satchel

1568
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,880
of that you might physically carry that you

1569
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:45,810
can put things in again and again,

1570
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,300
and with an array can you actually keep track of

1571
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:50,990
not just numbers but any kinds of things,

1572
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,740
other sprites or other pictures,

1573
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:55,070
or perhaps a little something like this.

1574
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,800
Let me go ahead and pull up this little example here.

1575
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,650
It looks like we're dwelling on only the most simple.

1576
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:03,740
Go ahead and click the green flag.

1577
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:06,410
You'll see this was written by a former student of ours.

1578
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:10,220
Notice the top left is a picture of inventory.

1579
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,350
That's just a graphical incarnation of this thing

1580
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:15,880
called an array and notice, the games can, in fact,

1581
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,570
interact with a human much like Wednesday,

1582
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,150
I'm leaving my house.

1583
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,440
Oh, here are some cherries.

1584
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:23,120
Oh, look. In my array at top left,

1585
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,480
they have now cherries in it.

1586
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,450
Let's see what this is, probably an orange.

1587
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:29,640
Let me go over here. And now think about how you do this.

1588
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:32,760
If right arrow key down, move right.

1589
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:34,430
If right arrow key down, move right.

1590
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:39,580
If touching sign, display this little cartoon bubble.

1591
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,160
So let me go get the pine apple,

1592
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,910
let me go get the bananas.

1593
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,520
Let me go get the apple.

1594
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,070
I think I--where do I have to go,

1595
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:47,060
the fruit place?

1596
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,760
Oh, there's a man at the store

1597
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,760
and now we have a loop

1598
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,840
where he is just looking through my inventory

1599
01:09:54,020 --> 01:10:00,050
one at a time and reciting what it is I actually picked up.

1600
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,810
Well, what more can we do with some of these fundamentals?

1601
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,660
Well, with arrays and the like, after arrays and the like,

1602
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,440
we have these things called threads.

1603
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:08,590
So thankfully,

1604
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,190
you can do multiple things at once in a

1605
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:11,210
program because of

1606
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:12,690
what we'll call threads.

1607
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,940
Here is an example in just a

1608
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:16,450
moment of a program, a scratch project,

1609
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,030
so to speak, with two sprites;

1610
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:19,760
one bird and one cat,

1611
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:21,440
and what this means is that even though

1612
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:23,100
the interface is getting a little complicated,

1613
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,390
realize the student did this with baby steps,

1614
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,260
implements in a little bit of this, a little bit of this,

1615
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:30,150
and then over time, it grows to be a pretty impressive program,

1616
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:32,290
but it starts off as just a clean slate.

1617
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:33,860
Notice at the bottom right here,

1618
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,590
we have all these different icons.

1619
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:39,740
I can click on this guy to see what sprites are controlling him.

1620
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,600
Here is where the guy yawned.

1621
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:42,990
It's because of that script.

1622
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,170
I can click on the cherries

1623
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:45,510
and see what they're doing,

1624
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:46,690
you know, not all that much.

1625
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:47,700
They're just sitting there,

1626
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,540
but they are listening for something we'll see in a moment.

1627
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:51,450
But let me go ahead and open up,

1628
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,530
let's say, this cat example,

1629
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:57,360
move two--you can even have different sprites

1630
01:10:57,570 --> 01:11:00,490
interact with each other much like this.

1631
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,800
Now, all the cat is doing is that it's an infinite loop

1632
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,350
and it's checking if I am not facing bird,

1633
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:11,150
face bird, and it's [noise]--

1634
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:13,280
It's constantly chasing the bird.

1635
01:11:13,450 --> 01:11:15,240
And so now, you have two threads so to speak,

1636
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,870
two miniature programs,

1637
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:19,860
two sprites all interacting with one another.

1638
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,190
You can do other things too,

1639
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:22,290
and I know I'm flying through these

1640
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:26,190
but only because it's more fun to play hands-on on your own—

1641
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,980
oh, actually, this guy is kinda funny. Let's play this.

1642
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:37,760
This is all he does.

1643
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,580
But again, it hints with these fundamentals.

1644
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:40,860
You've got a loop,

1645
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:41,790
you've got a condition and a boolean to

1646
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:42,890
check if he's touching the edge,

1647
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,340
and some statements to tell him to

1648
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:47,800
shout or to actually turn around.

1649
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:49,820
So what more is there?

1650
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:52,950
There are also these things called events in programming,

1651
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,440
and specifically, scratch,

1652
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:55,930
whereby you can have two sprites

1653
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:57,500
such as this boy and this girl,

1654
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:00,100
and when you actually hit the spacebar with the like—

1655
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:03,420
oops--if you actually hit the spacebar or the like,

1656
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,190
one sprite can do something,

1657
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:09,170
and then the other sprite can do something in response

1658
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:11,710
because in addition to When Green Flag Clicked,

1659
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,840
there's also this kind of starting point,

1660
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:15,600
this alternative to main that says

1661
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:17,400
When I Receive Event

1662
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:20,470
In other words, you can pass sort of secret messages

1663
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,990
or notes between sprites by giving them a name,

1664
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:24,760
like in this case, events,

1665
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:26,340
and then having one talk to the other.

1666
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:27,850
So this is a simple incarnation of that

1667
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,950
game you might know as Marco Polo.

1668
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:31,690
Now, in Problem Set Zero,

1669
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,390
well, you get to play with exactly these things

1670
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:35,800
and in the hacker edition if you so choose,

1671
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:37,460
can you play with one of these things.

1672
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,760
I taught I'd demo just a couple little snippets with this.

1673
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,440
So to be clear, we expect most students to very

1674
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:44,600
comfortably pursue the standard edition of the P set,

1675
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:46,170
but for this particular P set,

1676
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:47,590
the hacker edition gives you—

1677
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:50,340
and we have about 150 or so of these out on the hallway,

1678
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,320
and we'll have them at office hours throughout the coming

1679
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,710
week--this is a little logic board

1680
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:54,890
with lots of sensors;

1681
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:58,280
the sound sensor, a light sensor, a little joystick and the like.

1682
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,370
And now, that you have not just the keyboard,

1683
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,830
but a device like this connected via USB

1684
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,500
can you do something like this,

1685
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:06,690
like a former student did.

1686
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,940
This is a little game--and again,

1687
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,350
don't be overwhelmed by the complexity.

1688
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:13,480
It's all about building up bytes after bytes--

1689
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:20,220
So I'm now moving the joystick,

1690
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:23,050
and the goal of this game is not to hit

1691
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:26,090
--oh, to get the bananas,

1692
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,600
but now I've been stunned,

1693
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:29,320
there's the man that fell from

1694
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:31,880
the ceiling on Wednesday,

1695
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,450
and it's responding to the joystick.

1696
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:34,730
You can do other things too though,

1697
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:35,980
when you have sound.

1698
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:39,120
For instance, let me go ahead and open up masquerade,

1699
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:40,710
and I'll need Barry to help here,

1700
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:42,900
if you don't mind. Let me hit play.

1701
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:47,770
So here, we have--come on.

1702
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,730
Wait, don't do that yet.

1703
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:56,210
Come on. I need more lights. Wait a minute.

1704
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:01,300
We can solve this.

1705
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,910
It's a little dark in here as well.

1706
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,250
Okay. It's very nice and beautiful, daylight outside,

1707
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,010
and Barry, could you kill the lights?

1708
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:15,410
So can you actually detect sound in this way?

1709
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,530
Let me stop playing this since it will just go on ad nauseam as

1710
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:23,150
well. So what does this actually mean for you?

1711
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,540
So with problems at zero,

1712
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,300
which will be posted in two forms;

1713
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,350
PDF for standard and PDF for hacker

1714
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:29,460
on cs50.net tonight,

1715
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:32,500
you will have the choice of implementing pretty

1716
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,210
much any scratch projects you can think of,

1717
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,950
and which subject to very few constraints.

1718
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:38,350
At the end of the day, the goal is to

1719
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,750
make something that's of interest to you, fun for you,

1720
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:44,830
and you'll see at cs50.net/ohs for office hours,

1721
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,780
what the schedule is therefore.

1722
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:49,260
And let me conclude with this,

1723
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:53,200
you have an amazing 10 weeks ahead of you.

1724
01:14:53,600 --> 01:15:02,020
And so, we will see you if I time this correctly on Wednesday.
